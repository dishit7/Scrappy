Home Manage Loans Student Loan Forgiveness Public Service Loan Forgiveness Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) On This Page Qualifying for PSLF Qualifying Employment Full-time Employment Eligible Loans Qualifying Payments Qualifying Repayment Plans PSLF Process How to Submit the PSLF Form On This Page Qualifying for PSLF Qualifying Employment Full-time Employment Eligible Loans Qualifying Payments Qualifying Repayment Plans PSLF Process How to Submit the PSLF Form If you’re employed by a government or not-for-profit organization, you might be eligible for the PSLF Program. The PSLF Program forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after you’ve made the equivalent of 120 qualifying monthly payments under an accepted repayment plan , and while working full-time for an eligible employer . We’re working to apply changes announced in April 2022, as part of the payment count adjustment . These changes mean that borrowers with federally-managed loans may still see an increase in their payment counts toward income-driven repayment forgiveness and PSLF. How to Apply for PSLF To be considered for PSLF, you only need to submit a PSLF form. The easiest way to do this is by using the PSLF Help Tool. The PSLF Help Tool allows you to: Check to see if your employer is already in our employer database. Request that your employer’s eligibility be reviewed if it is not already in our database or has not yet had its eligibility determined. Prepare and sign your PSLF form, and request certification and signature from your employer—all electronically. Generate your PSLF form for manual signature and submission. Top tip: Certify your employment every year and any time you change employers. This lets you confirm you’re on track toward forgiveness. PSLF Resources PSLF Help Tool PSLF Employer Search PSLF Frequently Asked Questions Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) & Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF) Certification & Application (PSLF form) Submit a PSLF Reconsideration Request Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Buyback Qualifying for PSLF To qualify for PSLF, you must be employed by a U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government or qualifying not-for-profit organization (federal service includes U.S. military service); work full-time for that agency or organization; have Direct Loans (or consolidate other federal student loans into a Direct Loan) ; repay your loans under an income-driven repayment plan or a 10-year Standard Repayment Plan; and make a total of 120 qualifying monthly payments that need not be consecutive. Note: Upon reaching 120 qualifying payments while preparing your final PSLF form certifying your employment, make sure that the employment period is checked as “still employed” or certified (signed) by your employer in the same month as your employment end date. Qualifying Employment Qualifying employment for PSLF isn’t about the specific job that you do for your employer—it’s about who you work for. Use our employer search tool to see if your employer qualifies for PSLF. Which Employer Types Are Eligible Eligible Ineligible U.S.-based government organizations at any level (federal, state, local, or tribal) – this includes the U.S. military Not-for-profit organizations that are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code Other not-for-profit organizations that devote a majority of their full-time equivalent employees to providing certain qualifying public services For-profit organizations, including for-profit contracted organizations Labor unions Partisan political organizations Note: Serving as a full-time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer also counts as qualifying employment for the PSLF Program. What is a Professional Employer Organization (PEO)? And how does employment with a PEO affect eligibility for PSLF? A Professional Employer Organization (PEO) is an organization that provides administrative services, such as payroll and benefits, for another organization under a contractual agreement. PEOs are co-employers of an employee, but for PSLF purposes, the employee is considered a direct employee of the non-PEO employer. Generally, you must be directly employed by a qualifying employer for your employment to count toward PSLF and receive a W-2 for that employment. However, if you are co-employed by a qualifying employer but your W-2 is produced by an organization that provides payroll or similar services under contract with the qualifying employer you are still considered a direct employee of the qualifying employer. Am I eligible for PSLF if I’m a contractor? You must be a direct employee of a qualifying employer for your employment to qualify. This means that employees of contracted organizations, that are not themselves a qualifying employer, won’t qualify for PSLF including government contractors and for-profit organizations. However, an exception exists if you work in a state that has laws that prevent an otherwise qualifying employer from hiring employees directly to fill positions or provide services. This is most common in states that have laws preventing health care facilities from hiring employees directly, so they contract with physicians’ groups to provide services. If this is the case, the contracted employee should report the EIN of the qualifying employer on their PSLF form (not their direct employer whose EIN appears on their W-2 or 1099) and have an authorized official of the qualifying employer certify their employment as an employee filling a position or providing a service that cannot be filled or performed by a direct employee due to state law. A “contracted employee” can include an individual practicing as a sole proprietorship or as a partner, owner, or employee of a partnership, group, or professional corporation. The contracted organization may be a for-profit entity and employees may receive an IRS W-2, a 1099, and other tax forms from the contracted organization, depending on how it is organized. The qualifying employer can sign the certification if either of the following is true: The borrower is or was employed under a contract or by a contracted organization in a position that, under applicable state law, cannot be filled by a direct employee of the organization, or The borrower is or was providing services that, under applicable state law, cannot be provided by a direct employee of the organization. What do I do if my employer has closed or is unable or unwilling to certify my employment? If your PSLF form cannot be certified by an Authorized Official because the organization has closed or your employer is unable or unwilling to provide an acceptable signature, you may be able to certify your employment using alternative documentation. Electronic signature and submission will not be available in this circumstance, but you can still use the PSLF Help Tool to generate your PSLF form as a manual download. You will need to: provide an acceptable signature for yourself, and submit documentation that confirms both the FEIN/EIN of the employer as well as your period of employment. This may include an IRS Form W-2 for every calendar year included in your employment period (with or without corresponding paystubs), or paystubs for every month that you were employed during the employment period. It will take additional time to review and process your form and documents. Note that any month that doesn’t have supporting documentation can’t be certified as qualifying employment. A Message for Employers Have you received a request to certify and digitally sign an employee’s PSLF form? Borrowers seeking to benefit from PSLF are required to submit a PSLF form that verifies their employer and the dates of employment. Support your employee(s): learn how to complete the certification and signature process . Full-time Employment For PSLF, full-time employment is working for a qualifying employer(s) for a weekly average, alone or when combined, equal to at least 30 hours: during the period being certified; throughout a contractual or employment period of at least 8 months in a year, such as elementary and secondary school teachers, in which case the borrower is deemed to have worked full time for the entire year; or determined by multiplying each credit or contact hour taught per week by at least 3.35 in non-tenure track employment at an institution of higher education. Routine paid vacation or paid leave time provided by an employer, and leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2612(a)(1)) is to be included when determining if you are working full-time. Time spent on religious instruction, worship services, or any form of proselytizing as a part of your job responsibilities should be included when determining if you are working full-time. However, time spent providing volunteer work or services for which you are not paid should not be included when determining if you are working full-time. Eligible Loans Any loan received under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program qualifies for PSLF. Eligible Ineligible Direct Subsidized Loans Direct Unsubsidized Loans Direct PLUS Loans Direct Consolidation Loans Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Student loans from private lenders While a Direct PLUS loan made to a parent borrower is eligible for PSLF, it cannot be paid via a qualifying repayment plan (other than the 10-year standard repayment plan or a plan where the payment is equal or greater than the 10-year standard plan) unless it is first consolidated into a Direct Consolidation Loan. FFEL and Perkins loans may become eligible if you consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan. Payment Credits on Consolidation Loans If you consolidate your loans on or after September 1, 2024, the qualifying payments made on the Direct Loans (other loan types will not be considered) included in your consolidation loan will be credited to your consolidation loan using a weighted average of those payments. Borrowers are strongly encouraged to certify all their qualifying employment applicable to the loans before they are consolidated to ensure that weighted average is correctly applied. For example, a borrower with 60 qualifying payments on a Direct Loan with a balance of $30,000 who consolidates their loan with another Direct Loan with a balance of $30,000 with zero qualifying payments will have a new qualifying payment count of 30 payments credited to the new consolidation loan. As part of the payment count adjustment, ED will allow qualifying payments from all loans included in a Direct Consolidation Loan, including FFEL Program and Perkins loans, to contribute toward the qualifying payment count on the Direct Consolidation Loan. The payment count adjustment will not use a weighted average. See the payment count adjustment for additional details. Because of recent changes to the law, borrowers will be able to separat"},

Comparing School Aid Offers Comparing School Financial Aid Offers A school aid offer (sometimes called an award letter) tells you what financial aid you can receive at a particular college or career school. If you’ve applied to several schools, be sure to compare aid offers to see which school will be the most affordable. If you listed a school on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA ® ) form and have been offered admission by that school, the financial aid office at the school will send you an aid offer (often electronically). The offer includes the types and amounts of financial aid you may receive from federal, state, private, and school sources. This combination of aid is your financial aid package. You might get a tentative aid offer from a school and then find that it changes later. This could happen for a variety of reasons, such as if you indicated that you plan to live on campus when you submitted your FAFSA form but then later decided to live off campus or if you are selected for verification. Because your financial aid package is created for you and is based on the cost of attending a particular school, your aid amounts will vary from school to school. Figuring Out Net Price Follow these easy steps to figure out your net price , or net cost, for each school, and find out which school will be most affordable for you. First, find the cost of attendance for your program on the aid offer. If the school doesn’t list the cost of attendance on the aid offer, ask the financial aid office for this figure. Make sure it includes amounts you will pay to the school directly (such as tuition and fees) as well as other costs (such as living expenses, books and supplies, and transportation). Next, subtract the grant and scholarship amounts on your aid offer from the cost of attendance amount. Also subtract any savings you have available to put toward your school costs for the school year. The remaining amount is your net or out-of-pocket cost. Compare the net costs for the schools you are considering. The net cost is the amount you will have to pay out of your pocket, using earnings from work or loan funds that you borrow. If you have any questions or don’t understand what’s in your aid offer, contact the financial aid office at the school. It's there to help! For instance, it’s important to understand what you’re being offered (e.g., which items in the offer are grants and which are loans). You also need to think about which aid to accept . Also, because your aid offer might include student loans, it’s important for you to compare the amount of debt you would be taking on at the schools you are considering. If you find that you’ll need to take out a larger amount in private loans at one school than at another, you should pay special attention to the terms and conditions of the private loans so you understand what your obligations would be.

How you receive your aid will depend on the type of aid—grants, loans, or work-study.', 'body_content': "Loading... Home Complete the Financial Aid Process Receiving Financial Aid Receiving Financial Aid Your college or career school—not the U.S. Department of Education—will distribute your federal student aid. On This Page When You’ll Receive Your Financial Aid How You’ll Receive Your Financial Aid Buying Supplies Before Receiving Aid On This Page When You’ll Receive Your Financial Aid How You’ll Receive Your Financial Aid Buying Supplies Before Receiving Aid You’ve told your school which financial aid you want to accept. Learn about when and how you will receive the aid. When You’ll Receive Your Financial Aid The type of aid you accepted affects when you’ll get your aid. Grants and Student Loans Generally, your school will give you your grant or loan money in at least two payments called disbursements. In most cases, your school must give you your grant or loan money at least once per term (semester, trimester, or quarter). Schools that don’t use traditional terms such as semesters or quarters usually must give you your grant or loan money at least twice—for instance, at the beginning and midpoint of your academic year or program. Note: If you’re a parent taking out a Direct PLUS Loan to help pay for your child’s education expenses, your loan funds will be disbursed according to the same type of schedule. The following may apply if you haven’t taken out a federal student loan before: If you’re a first-year undergraduate student and a first-time borrower, you may have to wait 30 days after the first day of your enrollment period (semester, trimester, etc.) before your school is allowed to give you your loan money. Check with your school to see whether this rule applies. If you’re a first-time borrower of a Direct Subsidized Loan or a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must complete entrance counseling before your school can give you your loan money. If you are a graduate or professional student taking out a Direct PLUS Loan for the first time, you must complete entrance counseling before you receive your first loan disbursement . Note: Counseling isn’t required if you’re a parent taking out a Direct PLUS Loan to help pay for your child’s education. Work-Study If you’re going to have a work-study job, you’ll be paid at least once a month. If you don’t receive the type or amount of financial aid you expected, contact your school. The financial aid office can explain how your aid was determined. How You’ll Receive Your Financial Aid How you’ll get your aid depends on the type of aid you accepted. Grants and Student Loans Typically, the school first applies your grant or loan money toward your tuition, fees, and (if you live on campus) room and board . Any money left over is paid to you directly for other education expenses. If you get your loan money, but then you realize that you don’t need the money after all, you may cancel all or part of your loan within 120 days of receiving it and no interest or fees will be charged. Work-Study Your school must pay you directly unless you request that the school send your payments directly to your bank account or use the money to pay for education-related charges (e.g., tuition, fees, room and board) on your student account. Direct PLUS Loans for Parents In most cases, your child’s school will give you your loan money by crediting it to your child’s school account to pay tuition, fees, room, board, and other authorized charges. If there is money left over, the school will pay it to you. In some cases, with your permission, the school may give the leftover money to your child. If you take out a loan as a student or parent, your school (or your child’s school) will notify you in writing each time they give you any part of your loan money. At the same time, they’ll provide information about how to cancel all or part of your loan if you find you no longer need the full amount. You will also receive a notice from your loan servicer confirming that you received the loan money. Buying Supplies Before Receiving Aid Schools that participate in federal student aid programs must provide a way for you to obtain your books and supplies by the seventh day of the term if you are eligible for disbursement (i.e., the payment of your financial aid) 10 days before the term begins and you will have a credit balance (i.e., money left over) after your financial aid is applied to your tuition, fees, and other school charges as applicable. Your school can tell you if the above criteria apply to you. How Your School Gets Your Financial Aid Funds to You for Course Materials You should ask your financial aid office about this because it varies from school to school. For example, if the school offers a bookstore voucher or other means for students to receive their books and supplies through the school or its bookstore, you could obtain your materials that way. When your school gives you financial aid, sometimes money is left over after your aid is applied to your tuition, fees, and other school charges. This remaining amount is called a credit balance. If you have a credit balance, your school must pay this amount to you directly within 14 days unless you authorize the school to keep the money to pay for future institutional charges. The amount the school is required to provide is either the amount of your credit balance or the amount needed for books and supplies (as determined by your school), whichever is less. Your school can tell you if this applies to you. Even if the school’s preferred arrangement is to provide vouchers or other means for you to get your course materials through the school or its bookstore, the school must provide you the opportunity to opt out, receive a check from the school, and obtain the books and supplies on your own unless one of the following exceptions applies: The school can demonstrate a compelling health and safety reason for obtaining the materials through the institution or its supplier. The school can demonstrate that the materials are not currently available elsewhere or accessible to students via other means. Saving Money on Textbooks and Course Materials Depending on what materials are available at your school and for your courses, you may have several lower-cost options to obtain your books: If your course uses a hard-copy textbook, consider buying a used copy or renting your textbook from a bookstore or online. If you purchase your textbook, consider reselling that textbook, if allowed, when you are done with the course. Even with new textbooks, you may be able to save money by shopping around. Some schools use open-access texts and online content to offer students further savings over hard-copy textbooks. Open-access texts are available for free. If your course uses paid online content, your school may have negotiated a deal with the publisher that will allow you online access at a fraction of the cost you would pay for a physical book. The paid online content may also come with study tools and other content in addition to the textbook. Your options for course material formats will vary by school, instructor, and course, so learning what your options are and knowing about any cost-reduction initiatives your school may have can result in significant savings. A Note About ISBNs Your school must publish the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) for each course text in the online course schedule entry if the ISBN is available. The ISBN identifies the specific edition of the book that’s required for your class and helps you be sure you’re obtaining the right book when you search for it. If an ISBN is unavailable, the school should provide the author, title, publisher, and copyright date.

Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plan Request Apply for a new income-driven repayment (IDR) plan or recertify an existing IDR plan on this page. IDR plans often provide a lower monthly payment compared to other plans because they are based on your income and family size rather than your loan amount. If your situation changes, you have options, including having your IDR plan recalculated or switching to a new IDR plan. If you have parent PLUS loans, you must consolidate your loans to become eligible for an IDR plan. Application Unavailable A federal court issued an injunction preventing the U.S. Department of Education from implementing the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan and other income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. As a result, the IDR and loan consolidation applications are currently unavailable. New IDR Applicants Apply for an Income-Driven Repayment Plan There are four different IDR plans to choose from.

Borrowers currently not on an IDR plan who are seeking a lower monthly payment on their federal student loans. Borrowers currently on an IDR plan who need to recertify or make changes to their repayment plan. 10 minutes How Long Will it Take? Most people complete the application in 10 minutes or less. You can save and continue the application later, so you don\'t need to finish it in a single session. What Do I Need? A verified FSA ID Your financial information More Information Modal for FINANCIAL INFORMATION Close FINANCIAL INFORMATION You will be given the option to document your income electronically by granting us consent to access your information and import it into an IDR application. For security purposes we will not display your tax information on this application but will inform you that the retrieval was successful. If you do not want to use your adjusted gross income because your income has changed since you filed your last tax return, you can still submit the application electronically. As part of the online process, you will have the opportunity to upload documentation of income into your application. If you do not currently have any income, you will be allowed to self-certify that you do not have income on the online application. If you are married: Income-driven repayment plans are sometimes based on both your and your spouse’s income and loan information. Although your spouse does not need to be present when you apply, you will need their financial information for your application. Your personal information Your spouse’s information, if applicable Frequently Asked Questions What is an income-driven repayment plan? How do I pick between the different plans? Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are designed to make your student loan debt more manageable by giving you a monthly payment based on your income and family size. There are four different IDR plans, and your payment may be as low as $0 a month, depending on the plan you choose. Any remaining balance on your loan could be eligible for forgiveness after as few as 10 years of monthly payments, depending on how much you originally borrowed to attend school. During the time your loan is in repayment, your progress is tracked toward IDR forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). We offer four income-driven repayment plans: Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Repayment Plan Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan Under current regulations, the PAYE Plan is available only to borrowers who are already enrolled and is no longer accepting new enrollments. The ICR Plan is available only to borrowers who are already enrolled in the ICR Plan and to parent PLUS loan borrowers who consolidate to repay their loans. Loan Simulator can help you choose a plan by letting you estimate your monthly payment amount, repayment period, projected loan forgiveness, and total interest you\'ll pay over the life of your loan. Loan Simulator will ask for basic information about your income, family size, tax-filing status, and state of residence, then it will present different plan options for you to review and choose from. Some of the calculations shown in the income-driven repayment plan flow are estimates only and are based on several assumptions that may not apply to you. View all assumptions for IDR plans . Do I have to recertify my income every year? Yes. If you gave your consent to us to access your tax information and applied for an IDR electronically, we will take care of automatically recertifying your plan on its recertification date. If you choose to apply for an IDR plan manually, you will be responsible for managing the recertification of your IDR plan with your loan servicer. If your financial situation changes before your recertification date—due to a job change or layoff, for example—you can contact your loan servicer and ask for an immediate recalculation to see if your payment amounts can be adjusted. Can I check online to see if my loans are impacted by the one-time IDR payment count adjustment? The first group of eligible borrowers were informed by ED on July 14, 2023, that they have loans that qualified for forgiveness. No further action is required from these borrowers to get this forgiveness. ED will continue to identify and notify borrowers who reach the necessary forgiveness threshold of 240 or 300 months’ worth of qualifying payments, depending on the repayment plan and type of loan. We will send these notifications out every two months until next year, at which point all borrowers who are not yet eligible for forgiveness will have their payment counts updated. Your student loan servicer(s) will notify you directly after your forgiveness is processed. Make sure to keep your contact information up-to-date with your servicer and on StudentAid.gov. If you have not yet qualified for forgiveness, you will be able to see your exact payment counts for IDR in the future. Still have questions about income-driven repayment? Visit the Help Center .

This tool is for all borrowers who are interested in PSLF or TEPSLF. There is now only a single form that you need to complete to certify employment, or to receive PSLF or TEPSLF. 30 Minutes How long will it take? Most people complete the PSLF Help Tool process in less than 30 minutes. The process must be completed in a single session. What do I need? Your most recent W-2 Close What is a W-2? A W-2 is a Wage and Tax Statement, which your employer issues to you at the beginning of every calendar year so that you may prepare your Federal income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service. Close from your employer(s) OR Your employer's Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) Close What is a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN)? The Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN OR EIN) is a unique, nine-digit number assigned to entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. This number is used to confirm that the name of the organization that is submitted on your forms matches the name of the organization to which the Internal Revenue Service issued an EIN. You can use your employer’s EIN to find out if they qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program via our employer search tool . Close Learn More About Public Service Loan Forgiveness Please read the following question and answer section carefully to help determine whether Public Service Loan Forgiveness is right for you. What is the difference between PSLF and TEPSLF? PSLF forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 qualifying payments while working full-time for a qualifying employer. Only payments made under certain repayment plans (primarily income-driven repayment plans) qualify for PSLF. TEPSLF forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans, but is available if you do not qualify for PSLF only because some or all of your payments were made under a repayment plan that did not qualify for PSLF and you meet other requirements. TEPSLF is a temporary program and will end once a certain amount of loan forgiveness has been granted. What loans can be forgiven? Only Direct Loan Program loans that are not in default are eligible for PSLF and TEPSLF. Loans you received under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, the Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program, or any other student loan program are not eligible for PSLF. To find out which types of loans you have, log in to My Aid on StudentAid.gov using your account username and password . If you have FFEL Program or Perkins Loan Program loans, you may consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan to take advantage of PSLF and TEPSLF.  If you consolidate your loans after September 1, 2024, and the dates of your employment are prior to the consolidation, a weighted average will be applied to determine your qualifying payments from the loans included in your consolidation loan. Borrowers are strongly encouraged to certify all their qualifying employment applicable to the loans before they are consolidated to ensure that weighted average is correctly applied. Are loan amounts forgiven under PSLF or TEPSLF considered taxable by the IRS? No. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), student loan amounts forgiven under PSLF or TEPSLF aren’t considered income for tax purposes. For more information, check with the IRS or a tax advisor. What counts as a qualifying employer? Qualifying employers include governmental employers and many not-for-profit organizations. Use our PSLF Employer Search to see if your employer qualifies for PSLF. What counts as a government employer? Any U.S.-based government organization , or the Peace Corps or Americorps is considered a government employer for PSLF and TEPSLF. Federal service includes military service. A government contractor isn’t considered a government employer. Which not-for-profit organizations qualify? Eligible not-for-profit organizations include an organization that is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and Other not-for-profit organizations that devote a majority of their full-time equivalent employees to providing certain qualifying public services . However, if the organization is a labor union or a partisan political organization, it isn’t an eligible PSLF employer. What determines whether I am considered to be an employee of a qualifying employer? Qualifying employment for the PSLF isn’t about the specific job that you do for your employer—it’s about who you work for. Use our PSLF Employer Search to see if your employer qualifies for PSLF. What is the process to submit my PSLF form? PSLF Help Tool You may use the PSLF Help Tool to complete your PSLF form, send your form to your employers for their signature (certifying your employment), and electronically submit your form for processing. To complete PSLF Help Tool, you will need to log in with your account username and password. As you go through the tool, you will have an opportunity to apply your digital signature. Following that action, you will be presented with information and prompts to request your employer's signature. You will need to provide the correct email address for an authorizing official to receive an email from us requesting they certify your employment and digitally sign the form. Tell your employer to expect an email sent from DocuSign (dse_NA4@docusign.net) on behalf of the Department of Education's office of Federal Student Aid. After your employer has certified your employment and signed the form, it will be electronically submitted for processing. Manual PSLF form You may also submit a PSLF form by downloading the PDF after going through the PSLF Help Tool. While in tool, choose manual signature and on the next page select the View in My Activity button. From the My Activity page, download your form, print it, sign it, and have your employer(s) sign your form. Or, you can download and print a blank PDF of the form , complete all sections, sign it, and have your employer(s) sign it. If you submit a manual PSLF form, digital signatures from you or your employer must be hand-drawn (from a signature pad, mouse, finger, or by taking a picture of a signature drawn on a piece of paper that you then scan and embed on the signature line of the PSLF form) to be accepted. Typed signatures, even if made to mimic a signature, or security certificate-based signatures are not accepted. Then you will need to send the signed form to us for processing. You may send manual forms one of the following ways. Mail: U.S. Department of Education P.O. Box 300010 Greenville, TX 75403 Fax: 540-212-2415. You may upload your form by logging in to StudentAid.gov and navigating to My Activity. Will the employment periods I entered into the PSLF Help Tool for my PSLF form all be counted as qualifying payments for forgiveness? It depends as there are several reasons why some periods of employment may not be eligible for PSLF including periods of certain deferment or forbearance, periods while in an ineligible repayment plan, not making eligible payments, or your employer was not eligible for the entire period of your employment (e.g., your organization’s tax exemption status changed with the IRS). We will conduct a comprehensive review of the specific dates of your employment for eligibility with the submission of a PSLF form. Can I get PSLF sooner than 10 years? No. You must make payments to cover 120 separate monthly obligations. Paying extra won’t make you eligible to receive PSLF sooner. You may prepay, or make lump-sum payments, which first apply to any months during which you missed a payment and then would apply to future months up to your next income-driven payment (IDR) plan certification date or 12 months. For example, if you recertified your IDR and your monthly payment was $100, but you paid $1200 for the first month’s payment, that payment would count as 12 separate monthly payments for that year. You would not need to make another payment until the next 12-month cycle when you have to re-certify your income for IDR. These payments would count as qualifying payments toward PSLF forgiveness once you certified your employment with a qualifying employer for the same 12-month period (which you can’t do in advance).

Home Announcements & Events Joint Consolidation Loan Separation News and Updates On This Page What to Know About Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Separation of Joint Consolidation Loans New Direct Consolidation Loan Amount and Interest Rate Eligibility for the One-Time Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and PSLF Timing for Application and Separation Forbearance History of Joint Consolidation Loans On This Page What to Know About Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Separation of Joint Consolidation Loans New Direct Consolidation Loan Amount and Interest Rate Eligibility for the One-Time Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and PSLF Timing for Application and Separation Forbearance History of Joint Consolidation Loans Joint Consolidation Loan Separation News and Updates On Oct. 11, 2022, the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act (JCLSA) was signed into law to allow joint consolidation loan borrowers to separate their joint loan obligations and reconsolidate into new individual Direct Consolidation Loans. This new law allows borrowers struggling with their joint consolidation loans to receive significant benefits previously unavailable to them. You can learn more on this page about what the joint consolidation loan separation process involves, what additional benefits are available to borrowers who separate their joint consolidation loans into new individual Direct Consolidation Loans, and what deadlines borrowers need to be aware of. Apply Now What to Know About Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Separation of Joint Consolidation Loans Joint consolidation loan co-borrowers are now able to apply to separate their joint loan obligation into individual Direct Consolidation Loans by completing a Combined Application to Separate a Joint Consolidation Loan and a Direct Consolidation Loan Promissory Note (Application/Promissory Note). There are two ways for borrowers to apply: joint application and separate application . Joint Application The joint application option requires each joint consolidation co-borrower to request separation of the joint debt into new, individual Direct Consolidation Loans by completing and submitting an Application/Promissory Note that is used only for this purpose. The separation of the joint consolidation loan and creation of two new, individual Direct Consolidation Loans will not proceed unless completed applications have been received from both co-borrowers. Borrowers can send the application either to ED_Consolidation_Orig@aidvantage.studentaid.gov noting their desired final servicer or to one of the addresses listed in the application. Separate Application The separate application process allows just one of the joint consolidation loan co-borrowers to apply for separation of the joint debt, without regard to whether or when the other co-borrower applies to separate the debt. In this situation, the borrower who applies to separate the joint debt will have their portion of the debt converted into a Direct Consolidation Loan. The co-borrower who did not apply to separate will continue to be responsible for the original joint consolidation loan with a remaining balance equal to that borrower’s portion of the remaining balance. The non-applicant will be notified of the separation application and of their ability to submit an Application/Promissory Note to separate and receive a new individual Direct Consolidation Loan. Under the terms of the JCLSA, a separate application is permitted only if the individual co-borrower who is applying certifies that they have been a victim of domestic violence by the other borrower, have experienced economic abuse from the other borrower, or are unable to reasonably access the other borrower’s loan information, or if we otherwise determine that it would be in the best fiscal interest of the federal government to permit separate application. Borrowers can send the application either to ED_Consolidation_Orig@aidvantage.studentaid.gov noting their desired final servicer or to one of the addresses listed in the application. New Direct Consolidation Loan Amount and Interest Rate Under the joint application option, unless there is a divorce decree, court order, or settlement agreement that specifies a different distribution of the joint consolidation loan debt, each borrower’s new individual Direct Consolidation Loan will be made for an amount equal to the current outstanding balance of the joint consolidation loan (total of unpaid principal, accrued unpaid interest, and any outstanding fees), multiplied by the percentage of that outstanding balance attributable to the individual loans of each borrower that were repaid by the joint consolidation loan. Example If Spouse 1’s original loan balance was $20,000 and Spouse 2’s original loan balance was $60,000, the original joint consolidation loan balance would have been $80,000. The percentage of that initial balance attributable to Spouse 1 would be 25% ($80,000/$20,000 = 0.25 or 25%) and the percentage of the initial balance attributable to Spouse 2 would be 75% ($80,000/$60,000 = 0.75 or 75%). The joint consolidation loan currently has an outstanding balance of $45,000. This includes any current outstanding accrued interest and fees. When this loan is separated, the current outstanding balance will be multiplied by the percentage that each spouse initially contributed to the initial joint consolidation loan. So, Spouse 1 would have the current outstanding balance of the loan multiplied by 25% ($45,000 x 0.25 = $11,250) and Spouse 2 would have the current outstanding balance of the loan multiplied by 75% ($45,000 x 0.75 = $33,750). After the separation of the joint consolidation loan, Spouse 1 will have a new Direct Consolidation Loan with a balance of $11,250 and Spouse 2 will have a new Direct Consolidation Loan with a balance of $33,750. Each new Direct Consolidation Loan would have the same interest rate that was applicable to the original joint consolidation loan. Each new Direct Consolidation Loan will have the same interest rate that was in effect for the joint consolidation loan as of the day before the new loans were made. However, the borrower’s interest rate may change if the borrower adds another loan to their new consolidation loan within 180 days of the origination of the new consolidation loan. If there is a divorce decree, court order, or settlement agreement that specifies a distribution of the joint consolidation loan debt different from the proportional allocation described above, each borrower’s new Direct Consolidation Loan will be made for the amount stated in that legal order or agreement. A copy of the relevant documentation must be included with each co-borrower’s application to separate the debt. If just one of the co-borrowers requests separation of the joint consolidation loan under the separate application option, the new Direct Consolidation Loan will be made for an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding joint consolidation loan attributable to the individual loans of that co-borrower that were repaid by the joint consolidation loan, as described above for the joint application option. In this circumstance, the remaining joint consolidation loan amount (for which the other co-borrower will now be solely liable) will be equal to the portion of the outstanding joint consolidation loan balance attributable to that individual’s loans that were repaid by the joint consolidation loan. NOTE: Borrowers applying through the separate application process cannot provide a divorce decree, court order, or settlement agreement that specifies a distribution of the joint consolidation loan debt that is different from the proportional allocation. That option is available only for joint applications. Eligibility for the One-Time Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and PSLF Direct Joint Consolidation Loan borrowers and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program Joint Consolidation Loan borrowers serviced by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) received the payment count adjustment in 2024. If your joint consolidation loan was a Direct Loan and you met all other PSLF requirements, you also were credited with any earned progress toward PSLF forgiveness based on the payment count adjustment. If your JCL was a FFEL Program loan serviced by ED, then you did receive the adjustment, but your loan is not eligible for PSLF. If you are a FFEL joint consolidation loan borrower, regardless of whether your loan is serviced by ED or by a commercial lender, you will need to separate your loan and receive a new Direct Consolidation Loan in order to apply for PSLF. All joint consolidation loan borrowers that plan to separate their loan(s) have until June 30, 2025, to submit an Application/Promissory Note to receive the benefits of the payment count adjustment on their new Direct Consolidation Loan. If you submit your application on or after July 1, 2025, you will receive a weighted average of PSLF-eligible or IDR-eligible payments that was applied to the joint consolidation loan (not all payments are PSLF-eligible or IDR-eligible). If the joint consolidation loan is a FFEL joint consolidation loan, then no payments applied to the new Direct Consolidation Loan will be credited for PSLF, and only the weighted average of certain payments will be credited towards IDR forgiveness. Payments that result from the payment count adjustment will not be credited to your new Direct Consolidation Loan until after June 30, 2025, regardless of when the application was received. These Direct Loan borrowers can use the PSLF Help Tool or complete a PSLF Form to determine their employment eligibility. Joint Direct Consolidation Loan borrowers do not need to separate their loans to receive these benefits. Borrowers who have FFEL joint consolidation loans not serviced by ED and who complete the joint application process will both receive the payment count adjustment if they submit their Application/Promissory Notes by June 30, 2025, to separate their joint consolidation loan. For separate applications, the remaining co-borrower who did not submit an Application/Promissory Note to separate the joint debt will not receive this benefit until and unless that borrower submits the Application/Promissory Note by June 30, 2025. Additionally, ED has stored a record of the joint consolidation loan borrowers who took the required steps to express interest in the Limited PSLF Waiver before Oct. 31, 2022. These borrowers will need to submit an Application/Promissory Note to receive the benefits of the Limited PSLF Waiver by June 30, 2025. This benefit will be applied after the borrowers submit the Application/Promissory Note and the payment count adjustment occurs. Timing for Application and Separation Joint consolidation loan separations will begin on Dec. 31, 2024, but there may be a delay between the date that an application is submitted and the date that the actual separation of joint consolidation loans (and the origination of new Direct Consolidation Loans) occurs. Forbearance If you’ve already requested a forbearance while waiting for the joint consolidation loan separation process to begin, note that the forbearance will end on April 1, 2025, except under either of the two following conditions: For joint applications: Both co-borrowers submit an Application/Promissory Note by April 1, 2025 For separate applications: The co-borrower who requested the forbearance submits an Application/Promissory Note by April 1, 2025 History of Joint Consolidation Loans Beginning in 1992 and ending on July 1, 2006, married borrowers could consolidate their eligible individual federal student loans into a single joint consolidation loan. In doing so, both members of the couple had to agree to be held jointly liable for the combined debt without regard to the respective individual amounts consolidated and without regard to any later change to their marital status (for example, a divorce). In addition, the terms of joint consolidation loans specified that if one of the co-borrowers was unable to pay or refused to pay the loan, the other co-borrower could be held responsible for paying the full amount of the joint debt. These joint consolidation loans (sometimes referred to as “spousal consolidation loans”) were made under both the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 eliminated the ability of borrowers to apply for joint consolidation loans or to reconsolidate these loans as of July 1, 2006. This has prevented borrowers with joint consolidation loans made under the FFEL program from taking advantage of Direct Loan-only borrower benefits such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), more generous income-driven repayment options, or removing a loan from default status by reconsolidating it into a Direct Consolidation Loan.

Home Announcements & Events Natural Disasters: Information for Affected Individuals On This Page For Current Students For Borrowers Additional Resources On This Page For Current Students For Borrowers Additional Resources Natural Disasters: Info for Affected Individuals If you’re a student or a federal student loan borrower who has been impacted by a federally declared natural disaster (such as a wildfire, hurricane such as Helene or Milton, flood, or tornado), we can help answer your questions. We strongly encourage impacted students to contact the financial aid office at their school and borrowers to contact their lender or loan servicer. For Current Students The information in this section only applies to students that have been impacted by a federally declared natural disaster and who are enrolled in college or career school. What if I need to transfer to a different school? You should contact the financial aid office at your new school as soon as possible. That way the new school can request your federal student aid records from your old school, and help you if you need to request more federal student aid to attend. What are my options if my aid eligibility was impacted by a natural disaster but my FAFSA ® form doesn’t reflect this change? You do not need to make any changes to your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA ® ) form. If you feel that your eligibility for aid was impacted by the disaster, contact the financial aid office at your school to ask for a reassessment of eligibility. What if documentation that I need to apply for financial aid has been damaged or lost due to a natural disaster? You may be asked to provide documents to verify information on your FAFSA form. If the requested documents have been lost or destroyed by the disaster, immediately inform the school that asked for the records. That school may decide to not require those documents or might work with you to find alternative documentation. On my FAFSA ® form, do I need to claim any disaster-related support I received from the government? No. You may have received special aid from the federal government or from your state government. For the purpose of providing financial relief, this special aid should not be counted as income, other resources, or other financial assistance when determining your eligibility for federal student aid. For Borrowers The information in this section only applies to borrowers that have been impacted by a federally declared natural disaster . Your Loan Servicer Is Here To Help The federal loan servicing team checks the Federal Emergency Management Agency website at least once each business day to identify all impacted areas connected to a disaster declaration. After a natural disaster, the loan servicing team quickly reaches out to borrowers that live in the impacted areas to notify them of the options available to them. Loan servicers also post information on their websites regarding options. I was impacted by a recent natural disaster, and I’m having trouble making loan payments. What are my options? If you’ve been affected by a natural disaster in the area where you live or work, you can ask your loan servicer to pause or reduce your loan payments for up to 90 days through a natural disaster forbearance. Your servicer will place your loan into forbearance, which will prevent payments from being due during that period. Please note that interest still accrues (adds up) during the forbearance period, and you will still be responsible for paying that interest in the future. Once the initial forbearance period related to the disaster is over, you may ask for more forbearance time. Your servicer can grant additional forbearance time, in 30-day increments. But your total period of forbearance can’t exceed a maximum of 12 monthly billing cycles from the date of the disaster. I’m behind on my federal student loan payments. Can I get a forbearance? If you’re delinquent on your loan payments, your servicer can apply the forbearance for 30 days into the future and cover any past delinquency. But at the end of the forbearance (or consecutive periods of forbearance), you will be responsible for paying the interest that accrued during the period of delinquency along with your loan principal. I need to provide documentation to my loan servicer soon. Can I get an extension of the deadline? Yes. Sometimes you need to submit certain documents within a specified timeframe. Your servicer can extend your deadline if you live in an impacted area. Documents submitted by the revised deadline would be considered on time. I received a TEACH Grant and a federally declared major disaster prevented me from being able to teach. What do I do? If you were teaching to satisfy your TEACH Grant service obligation but are unable to finish the school year due to a federally declared major disaster, and you meet certain other requirements, you may still be able to receive credit for a full year of teaching. Call 1-888-303-7818 for more information. You also can temporarily suspend the period for completing your TEACH Grant service obligation if you’re unable to teach because you live or work in a federally declared major disaster area. To ask for a suspension, download the TEACH Grant Service Obligation Suspension Request: Residing or Being Employed in a Federally Declared Major Disaster Area from the “TEACH Grants” section of the Forms Library. Then, upload your completed suspension request on StudentAid.gov . Note: You must ask for a suspension before you run out of time to complete your TEACH Grant service obligation and your grants are converted to loans. If your request for a suspension is approved, the period of the suspension does not count toward the eight-year period for completing your service obligation. Note: There is a processing pause on discharge requests and some suspension requests. You can upload, mail, or fax any request, but discharge requests and military service, military spouse, and disaster area suspension requests will be held for processing until spring 2025. Learn more about the TEACH Grant program servicing transition . I’m in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, and I was affected by a recent natural disaster. Can I get an extension of my payment due date? You don’t need to request an extension. A month is eligible for PSLF if your payment satisfies the full amount due even if that amount is received after your payment due date or you are eligible for a qualifying deferment or forbearance at any time during the month. But for that month to count toward PSLF forgiveness, you must also have qualifying employment certified for the same month. Note: A federally declared natural disaster forbearance is a qualifying forbearance that would count as a payment equivalent in the PSLF program. My federal student loan is in default. What are my options? Upon request from you, a relative of yours, or any other responsible party, we will suspend collections of a defaulted loan for 90 days. The suspension will include suspension of involuntary payments such as administrative wage garnishment and Treasury offset . If you’re making payments toward rehabilitation of a defaulted loan, you will be allowed to stop making payments for those 90 days. At the end of the 90 days, you will either be able to pick up where you left off (e.g., if you had made six payments toward rehabilitation before the disaster, you could make three more to complete the rehabilitation process) or make up your missed payments in one lump sum in order to rehabilitate by your original planned date. I have a federal student loan and I was not able to complete my school year due to a natural disaster. What are my options? You will be provided with an extended “in-school” status until you officially withdraw or reenroll in the next regular enrollment period, whichever is earlier. This extension will prevent you from entering repayment status on your loans. Contact your school to request this extension.
